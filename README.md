## Design System

All design tokens live in `app/globals.css` under the `@theme` block. This is the single source of truth for the entire project.

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-bg-primary` | `#080b14` | Page background, hero, sections |
| `--color-bg-secondary` | `#0d1117` | Navbar, footer |
| `--color-bg-card` | `#111827` | Cards |
| `--color-brand-purple` | `#a855f7` | Primary CTA, logo, icons |
| `--color-brand-cyan` | `#22d3ee` | Active states, accents, progress bars |
| `--color-text-secondary` | `#9ca3af` | Subtitles, descriptions |

To change a colour across the entire app, update its token here — no hunting through component files.

## Key Conventions

**Server vs Client Components** — every component is a Server Component by default (no JavaScript shipped to the browser). Only components that need hooks or interactivity use `"use client"`. Currently only `Navbar` (uses `usePathname`) and `NewsletterCTA` (uses `useState`) are client components.

**Data-driven components** — cards, nav links, and footer columns are all driven by arrays defined at the top of each file. Adding a new card or link means editing the data array, not the JSX.

**Token-based styling** — never hardcode hex values in components. Always use the Tailwind utility classes that map to CSS tokens (e.g. `bg-brand-purple`, `text-text-secondary`).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root for local secrets. This file is gitignored and should never be committed.

```bash
# .env.local
# Add your environment variables here as the backend is integrated
```
